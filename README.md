Online gaming is hugely popular with children and young
people.From sport related games to mission based games and
quests inspiring users to complete challenges,
interactive games cater for a wide range of interests,
and can enable users to link up and play together.
Most games now have an online element to them;
allowing users to take part in leader boards, join group
games or chat to others. Internet connectivity in a game
adds a new opportunity for gamers as it allows players
to find and play against, or with, other players. These
may be their friends or family members or even other
users in the game from around the world.
